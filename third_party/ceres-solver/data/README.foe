The *.foe files contain coefficients provided by Stefan Roth, who agreed to

The coefficients in the *.foe files have been obtained by extracting the
matrices from the MATLAB files and performing matrix multiplication.

The format of the files is ASCII:
  <s = filter size> <K = number of filters>
  <alpha_1> ... <alpha_K>
  <f_1,1> ... <f_1,s^2>
  ...
  <f_K,1> ... <f_K,s^2>
