$section Changes and Additions to CppAD During 2017$$

$head API Changes$$
Speed tests no longer automatically compile in release mode; see
$cref/debug_which/speed/debug_which/$$

$head 12-14$$
Add the $cref subgraph_hes2jac.cpp$$ example
which computes sparse Hessians using subgraphs and Jacobians.

$head 12-08$$
A multi-threading
wish list item was added.

$head 12-06$$
A $cref wish_list$$ item to enable one to iterate through a
$code const$$ $cref ADFun$$ operation sequence was completed.
In addition, the $cref/f/abs_normal_fun/f/$$ argument to the
$code abs_normal$$ operation was converted to be $code const$$.


$head 12-05$$
The internal data object used to represent sparsity patterns as
vectors of integers was improved;
see $cref/internal_bool/for_jac_sparsity/internal_bool/$$
in $code for_jac_sparsity$$ and other
$cref/preferred sparsity pattern calculations
    /sparsity_pattern
    /Preferred Sparsity Pattern Calculations
/$$.

$head 12-04$$
Back out the $code hold_reverse_memory$$ option.

$head 12-01$$
The $code hold_reverse_memory$$ option was added.

$head 11-30$$
Edit the $cref download$$ instructions.

$head 11-23$$
The $code ADFun$$ function $cref/optimizer/optimize/$$
was not handling hash code collisions properly.
To be specific, only the arguments
that were variables where checked for a complete match.
The arguments that are constants need to also be checked.
This has been fixed.

$head 11-20$$
$list number$$
Add the $cref subgraph_jac_rev$$ method for computing
sparse Jacobians.
$lnext
Add the $cref/subgraph/speed_main/Global Options/subgraph/$$ option
to the CppAD speed tests.
$lend

$head 11-19$$
Add the $cref subgraph_reverse$$ method for computing
sparse derivatives.
This was inspired by the
$href%https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TMB/index.html%TMB%$$ package.


$head 11-15$$
$list number$$
Add wish list item for $cref/subgraph sparsity/wish_list/Subgraph/Sparsity/$$.
$lnext
Fix $cref cmake_check$$ when $cref ipopt_prefix$$ is not present on the
$cref cmake$$ command line
(make was trying to build some of the ipopt tests).
$lend

$head 11-13$$
$list number$$
Add the $cref/hes2jac/speed_main/Global Options/hes2jac/$$ option
to the CppAD speed tests.
$lnext
Implement the
$cref/subsparsity/speed_main/Sparsity Options/subsparsity/$$ option
for the CppAD $cref/sparse_hessian/link_sparse_hessian/$$ test.
$lnext
Fix detection of invalid options in the speed test programs; see the
$cref/global/speed_main/Global Options/$$ and
$cref/sparsity/speed_main/Sparsity Options/$$ options.
$lend

$head 11-12$$
Add the $cref/subsparsity/speed_main/Sparsity Options/subsparsity/$$ option
to the CppAD speed tests.

$head 11-08$$
Add the $cref subgraph_sparsity$$ method for computing
dependency and sparsity.
This was inspired by the
$href%https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TMB/index.html%TMB%$$ package.


$head 11-06$$
More information has been added to the operation sequence.
To be specific, the extra amount of
$codei%
    %f%.size_op() * sizeof(%tape_addr_type)
%$$
was added to the value returned by
$cref/size_op_seq/seq_property/size_op_seq/$$.

$head 11-04$$
The method for iterating through the tape has been changed.
It now includes an extra data structure that makes it faster,
but also requires slightly more memory. To be specific, the term
$codei%
    %f%.size_op() * sizeof(%tape_addr_type) * 2
%$$
was added to the value returned by
$cref/size_op_seq/seq_property/size_op_seq/$$.
In addition, some minor corrections were made to the
$cref/tape_addr_type/cmake/cppad_tape_addr_type/$$
requirements.

$head 10-23$$
$list number$$
Require $code cmake.3.1$$ or greater and fix
a cmake warning by always using the new $code CMP0054$$ policy.
$lnext
Fix a $code g++ 7.2.1$$ warning about a possibly uninitialized value
in the file $code cppad/local/optimize/hash_code.hpp$$.
$lend

$head 09-16$$
An optimization memory entry
was added to the wish list
and the $cref/check_finite/wish_list/check_finite/$$ entry was modified.

$head 08-30$$
$list number$$
If $cref colpack_prefix$$ was not specified, one would get the following
waring during the $cref cmake$$ command:
$codei%
    Policy CMP0046 is not set: Error on non-existent dependency in
%$$
This has been fixed by not adding the dependency when it is not needed.
$lnext
There was a problem running $cref/make check/cmake_check/$$
when $cref/cppad_cxx_flags/cmake/cppad_cxx_flags/$$ was not specified.
This has been fixed.
This was probably introduced on $cref/05-29/whats_new_17/05-29/$$.
$lend


$head 08-29$$
There was a problem on some systems that created an error when
specializing the $code is_pod$$ template function in the
$code CppAD::local$$ namespace.
This has been fixed by testing for compatibility at during the
$cref cmake$$ command and creating the file $code cppad/local/is_pod.hpp$$.


$head 08-09$$
Add the $cref/test_boolofvoid/wish_list/test_boolofvoid/$$
wish list item.

$head 08-08$$
$list number$$
The $cref eigen_plugin.hpp$$ was put back in the
$cref cppad_eigen.hpp$$ definitions.
This makes CppAD incompatible with older versions of eigen; e.g., eigen-3.2.9.
The plugin was removed on $cref/05-12/whats_new_17/05-12/$$.
$lnext
Fix some minor typos in the documentation.
To be specific:
The font, in the $cref sparse_rc$$ and $cref sparse_rcv$$ syntax,
for the text
$codei%
    %target% = %pattern%
%$$
The font, in $cref capacity_order$$, for the text
$codei%
    %xq%.size() == %f%.Domain()
%$$
Remove a percent sign $code %$$, in $cref CppAD_vector$$, in the text
$codei%
    # include <cppad/utility/vector.hpp>
%$$
$lend

$head 07-25$$
$list number$$
Fix warnings related to type conversions that
occurred when one used $code -Wconversion$$ with
$code g++$$ version 6.3.1.
$lnext
The warning were not fixed for complex AD types; e.g.,
$cref complex_poly.cpp$$.
The $cref wno_conversion$$ include file was added to deal with
cases like this.
$lend

$head 07-03$$
$list number$$
The $cref min_nso_linear$$ abs-normal example was added.
$lnext
Fix bug in $cref abs_normal_fun$$, to be specific, the multiplication
of a variable on the left by a parameter was not handled.
$lend

$head 07-01$$
the $cref/abs_normal/example_abs_normal/$$ examples were converted from using
quadratic programming problems to using linear programming problems.

$head 06-28$$
The $cref/abs-normal/abs_normal_fun/$$
representation of non-smooth functions has been added.
Examples and utilities that use this representation have also been included,
see $cref/abs_normal/example_abs_normal/$$.

$head 06-11$$
The atomic functions base class $cref atomic_two$$
makes more of an effort to avoid false sharing cache misses.
This may the speed of multi-threaded applications with atomic functions;
e.g., see $cref multi_atomic_two.cpp$$.

$head 06-10$$
$list number$$
Add the multi-threading atomic function example
$cref multi_atomic_two.cpp$$.
$lnext
The $code example/multi_thread/test_multi$$ directory used
to have an example using the deprecated
$cref atomic_one$$ functions in a multi-threading setting
(that only built with the deprecated $cref autotools$$).
This have been removed.
$lend

$head 06-07$$
The multi-threading examples
$cref harmonic.cpp$$ and $cref multi_newton.cpp$$ were re-organized.
To be specific, the source code for each example was moved to one file.
In addition, for each example,
the documentation for each of the routines has been separated
and placed next to its source code.

$head 06-04$$
Most all the $cref deprecated$$ features have been removed
from the examples with the exception of those in the
$code example/deprecated$$ directory.

$head 06-03$$
Add the fact that the pair
($icode row$$, $cref/col/link_sparse_hessian/col/$$)
is lower triangular to the speed test
$code link_sparse_hessian$$ routine.


$head 06-01$$
$list number$$
There was a bug in the
$cref sparse_hes$$ routine and it was using the general coloring algorithm when
$cref/cppad.symmetric/sparse_hes/coloring/cppad.symmetric/$$ was specified.
This has been fixed and improves the efficiency in this case.
$lnext
Some bugs were fixed in the use of
$cref/colpack/colpack_prefix/$$ as the coloring algorithm for
sparse Jacobian and Hessian calculations.
This has improved the efficiency of Colpack colorings for computing Hessians
(when $code colpack.symmetric$$ is used).
$lnext
The $code colpack.star$$ coloring method for sparse Hessians has
been deprecated; see
$cref/sparse_hes/sparse_hes/coloring/colpack.star Deprecated 2017-06-01/$$
and
$cref/sparse_hessian
    /sparse_hessian
    /work
    /colpack.star Deprecated 2017-06-01
/$$.
Use the $code colpack.symmetric$$ method instead; see
$cref/sparse_hes/sparse_hes/coloring/colpack.symmetric/$$ and
$cref/sparse_hes/sparse_hes/coloring/colpack.general/$$.
$lend

$head 05-29$$
$list number$$
Add the capability to compile so that CppAD debug and release mode
can be mixed; see
$cref/CPPAD_DEBUG_AND_RELEASE
    /preprocessor
    /Documented Here
    /CPPAD_DEBUG_AND_RELEASE
/$$.
$lnext
Add the $cref/cppad_debug_which/cmake/cppad_debug_which/$$ flags
that determines which files are compiled for debugging versus release
during the CppAD testing; see $cref cmake_check$$.
$lnext
There was a problem linking the proper libraries for using newer versions of
$cref/sacado/sacado_prefix/$$.
This has been fixed.
$lend

$head 05-19$$
Most all the examples have been moved to $code example$$ directory
and grouped as sub-directories; e.g., the $cref ipopt_solve$$ examples
are in the $code example/ipopt_solve$$ directory.

$head 05-14$$
$list number$$
The file $code build.sh$$ was moved to $code bin/autotools.sh$$,
and `auto tools' has been changed to $cref autotools$$.
$lnext
The README file was replace by readme.md
and AUTHORS was moved to authors.
$lnext
The NEWS, INSALL, and ChangeLog files
are no longer necessary for autotools build and have been removed.
$lnext
The file test_more/sparse_jacobian.cpp generated a warning
under some gcc compiler options.
This has been fixed.
$lnext
Specifications were added so that $cref to_string$$ yields exact results
for integer types and machine precision for floating point types.
$lnext
Some editing was done to the $cref autotools$$ instructions.
$lend

$head 05-12$$
$list number$$
The $cref Faq$$ has been updated.
$lnext
Remove includes of $code cppad/cppad.hpp$$ from the
$codei%include/cppad/speed/%*%.hpp%$$ files.
This avoids an incompatibility between sacado and newer versions of eigen,
when eigen is used for the $cref testvector$$.
$lnext
The $cref/eigen/eigen_prefix/$$ package changed its requirements for
defining Scalar types
(some where between eigen-3.2.9 and eigen-3.3.3).
The member variable
$cref/digit10/numeric_limits/digits10/$$ was added to the
$code numeric_limits$$ to accommodate this change.
$lnext
Note that this fix required adding $code digits10$$ to the
user defined $icode Base$$ type
$cref/requirements/base_require/$$; see
$cref base_limits$$.
$lnext
In addition, it is no longer necessary to add the typedef
$codei%
    typedef Scalar value_type;
%$$
so the file $code cppad/example/eigen_plugin.hpp$$ has been removed.
(This type definition was previously necessary for eigen vectors
to be $cref/simple vectors/SimpleVector/$$.)
$lend

$head 04-08$$
The $cref/optimization/optimize/$$, with a large number of
$cref/conditional expressions/CondExp/$$, was performing many
memory allocations and deallocations. This has been reduced.


$head 04-02$$
Fix a bug in the optimization of conditional expressions; see,
$cref/no_conditional_skip/optimize/options/no_conditional_skip/$$.

$head 03-31$$
Fix some $code valgrind$$ errors that occurred while running the CppAD
test set.

$head 03-29$$
The following valgrind error might occur when the optimize skipped
setting values that did not affect the dependent variables:
$codei%
    Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
%$$
This was not a bug, the code has been changed to avoid this error
in order to make it easier to use valgrind with CppAD.

$head 03-25$$
$list number$$
The $cref sparse_hes$$ function was more efficient if
there were more entries in each row of the requested
$cref/subset/sparse_hes/subset/$$. This has been changed
to more entries in each column, and documentation to this effect
was included.
$lnext
The $cref optimize$$ routine was using to much memory when
it was optimizing conditional skip operations; see
$cref/no_conditional_skip/optimize/options/no_conditional_skip/$$.
This has been fixed.
$lend

$head 03-20$$
There was a mistake in $cref sparse_jac$$ that caused the
following assert to mistakenly occur:
$codep
sparse_jac_rev: work is non-empty and conditions have changed
Error detected by false result for
    color.size() == 0 || color.size() == n
$$
A test that using a previously stores work vector
has been added to $cref sparse_jac_rev.cpp$$
and this bug has been fixed.

$head 03-13$$
The documentation for the Hessian in $cref rev_hes_sparsity$$ was
transposed; i.e., the sense of
$cref/transpose/rev_hes_sparsity/transpose/$$ was reversed.

$head 03-11$$
Add sparse assignment statements; see $icode target$$ for
$cref/sparse_rc/sparse_rc/target/$$ and
$cref/sparse_rcv/sparse_rcv/target/$$.

$head 03-10$$
Add the a sizing constructor to the
$cref/sparse_rc syntax/sparse_rc/Syntax/$$; i.e.,
a constructor that sets the number of row, number of columns,
and number of possibly non-zero values in the sparsity pattern.

$head 03-06$$
Fix a bug in the sparsity computation using the
internal representation for
$cref/vectors of sets/glossary/Sparsity Pattern/Vector of Sets/$$;
i.e., when $icode internal_bool$$ was false in
any of the $cref sparsity_pattern$$ calculations; e.g.,
$cref/for_jac_sparsity/for_jac_sparsity/internal_bool/$$.

$head 03-04$$
Fix a bug in the optimization of conditional expressions;
see $cref/no_conditional_skip/optimize/options/no_conditional_skip/$$.

$head 02-26$$
$list number$$
Fix warning during $cref cmake$$ command,
on $href%https://www.cygwin.com/%cygwin%$$ systems,
about $code WIN32$$ not being defined.
$lnext
Add $cref/element-wise atomic operations
    /wish_list
    /Element-wise Atomic Operations
/$$
to the wish list.
$lend

$head 02-21$$
$list number$$
Minor improvements to syntax and documentation for
$cref sparse_rc$$ and $cref sparse_rcv$$.
$lnext
Separate preferred sparsity versions in
$cref sparsity_pattern$$ and $cref sparse_derivative$$.
$lend

$head 02-19$$
$list number$$
Remove the $code bool_sparsity.cpp$$ example and
add the $cref rc_sparsity.cpp$$ example.
$lnext
Check for duplicate entries during
$cref/row_major/sparse_rc/row_major/$$ and $code col_major$$ in
$code sparse_rc$$.
$lend

$head 02-15$$
Fix bug when using $cref ForSparseHes$$ with atomic functions; i.e.,
$cref atomic_two_for_sparse_hes$$.

$head 02-13$$
Improve $cref/for_sparse_jac/atomic_two_eigen_mat_mul.hpp/Private/for_sparse_jac/$$
calculation in $code eigen_mat_mul.hpp$$ example.
It now checks for the parameter zero and does not propagate any sparsity
in this case (because the result is always zero).

$head 02-11$$
$list number$$
Remove the 'Under Construction' heading from the
$cref sparse_rc$$ and $cref sparse_rcv$$ documentation; i.e.,
they are ready for public use (part of the CppAD API).
$lnext
Fix some warning that occur when using
$cref/eigen/cppad_testvector/eigen/$$ for the CppAD test vector.
(The Eigen vector $code size()$$ function
returns an $code int$$ instead of $code size_t$$.)
$lnext
Fix a bug in $cref/sparse_jac_rev/sparse_jac/$$.
$lend

$head 02-10$$
$list number$$
The subset of deprecated features corresponding to
the cmake command option $code cppad_deprecated=YES$$
have been completely removed.
$lnext
Fix problems with $cref autotools$$ build
(started near 02-01 while working on sparsity branch).
$lnext
Reorder (better organize) the $cref ADFun$$ documentation section.
$lend

$head 02-09$$
$list number$$
Remove the sparsity pattern wish list item.
For sparsity patterns, this was completed by
$cref sparse_rc$$ and the sparsity pattern routines that used it;
e.g., $cref for_jac_sparsity$$.
For sparse matrices, it was completed by
$cref sparse_rcv$$ and the sparse matrix routines that use it; e.g.,
$cref sparse_jac$$.
$lnext
Add the Deprecated and
$cref/example/wish_list/Example/$$ items to the wish list.
(The Deprecated item was partially completed and partially removed.)
$lend

$head 02-08$$
$list number$$
Make coloring a separate argument to
$cref/sparse_jac/sparse_jac/coloring/$$ and
$cref/sparse_hes/sparse_hes/coloring/$$.
$lnext
Add the
$cref/group_max/sparse_jac/group_max/$$
argument to the $code sparse_jac_for$$ function.
$lend

$head 02-05$$
$list number$$
Add the $cref/sparse_jac_for/sparse_jac/$$ routine
which uses $cref sparse_rc$$ sparsity patterns
and $cref sparse_rcv$$ matrix subsets.
$lnext
Order for $cref sparse_rc$$ row-major and column-major was switched.
This has been fixed.
$lend

$head 02-03$$
Add the
$cref rev_jac_sparsity$$
$cref rev_hes_sparsity$$, and
$cref for_hes_sparsity$$ interfaces to sparsity calculations.
These use $cref sparse_rc$$ sparsity patterns.

$head 02-02$$
Change $cref/size_forward_bool/for_jac_sparsity/f/size_forward_bool/$$ and
Change $cref/size_forward_set/for_jac_sparsity/f/size_forward_set/$$
so that they are a better approximation of the number of bytes
(unsigned characters) being used.
The exact same sparsity pattern might use different memory
in two different function objects (because memory is allocated in chunks).
The $cref fun_assign.cpp$$ example has been changed to reflect this fact.

$head 02-01$$
Add the $cref for_jac_sparsity$$ interface for the sparse Jacobian calculations.
This is the first use of $cref sparse_rc$$,
a sparsity pattern class that uses row and column
$cref/index vectors/glossary/Sparsity Pattern/Row and Column Index Vectors/$$.

$head 01-30$$
Move the $cref sparsity_pattern$$ examples from $code example$$
to $code example/sparse$$ subdirectory.
This included the sparse $cref/driver/drivers/$$ examples.

$head 01-29$$
Move the $cref utility$$ examples from $code example$$
to $code example/utility$$ subdirectory.

$head 01-27$$
Add a $cref addon$$ link to
$href%http://www.seanet.com/~bradbell/cppad_swig%cppad_swig%$$,
a C++ AD object library and swig interface to Perl, Octave, and Python.

$head 01-19$$
Convert more examples / tests to use a multiple of machine epsilon
instead of $code 1e-10$$.

$head 01-18$$
$list number$$
Fix developer
$href%https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/Doc/doxydoc/html/%doxydoc%$$
documentation so that it works with newer version of doxygen.
$lnext
Fix a Visual C++ 2015 compilation problem in friend declarations
in the file $code cppad/local/ad_tape.hpp$$.
$lend

$head 01-17$$
Change computed assignment to
$cref/compound assignment/compound_assign/$$.

$end
