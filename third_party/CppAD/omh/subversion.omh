$section Using Subversion To Download Source Code$$

$head File Format$$
The files corresponding to this download
procedure are in Unix format; i.e.,
each line ends with just a line feed.

$head Subversion$$
You must have
$href%http://subversion.tigris.org/%subversion%$$
installed to use this download procedure.
In Unix, you can check if subversion
is already installed in your path by entering the command
$codep
    which svn
$$


$head OMhelp$$
The documentation for CppAD is built from the source code files using
$href%http://www.seanet.com/~bradbell/omhelp/%OMhelp%$$.
In Unix, you can check if OMhelp
is already installed in your path by entering the command
$codep
    which omhelp
$$

$head Current Version$$
The following command will download the
current version of the CppAD source code:
$codei%
    svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/CppAD/%dir% %dir%
%$$
where $icode dir$$ is replaced by $code trunk$$.
To see if this has been done correctly, check for the following file:
$codei%
    %dir%/include/cppad/cppad.hpp
%$$

$head Stable Versions$$
Subversion downloads are available for a set of stable versions
(after the specified date, only bug fixes get applied).
The following link will list the available $icode dir$$ values
corresponding to
$href%
    https://projects.coin-or.org/CppAD/browser/stable%
    stable versions
%$$.
The following command will download a
stable version of the CppAD source code:
$codei%
    svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/CppAD/stable/%dir% %dir%
%$$

$codei%
    %dir%/include/cppad/cppad.hpp
%$$
Note that it will correspond to the most recent release for this stable
version.

$head Release Versions$$
Subversion downloads are available for a set of release versions
(no changes are applied).
The following link will list the available $icode dir$$ values
corresponding to
$href%
    https://projects.coin-or.org/CppAD/browser/releases%

$codei%
    svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/CppAD/releases/%dir% %dir%
%$$
To see if this has been done correctly, check for the following file:
$codei%
    %dir%/include/cppad/cppad.hpp
%$$

$head Build the Documentation$$
Now build the documentation for this version using the commands
$codei%
    cd %dir%
    bin/autotools.sh configure omhelp
%$$

$head Continue with Installation$$
Once the steps above are completed,
you can proceed with the install instructions in
the documentation you just built.
Start by opening the file
$codei%
    %dir%/doc/index.xml
%$$
in a web browser and proceeding to the
install instructions in that documentation,
skipping the Download section and starting with the Configure command.
