$section Checking the CppAD Examples and Tests$$

$head Purpose$$
After you configure your system with the
$cref/cmake command/cmake/CMake Command/$$ you
can run the CppAD example and tests to make sure that
CppAD functions properly on your system.


$head Check All$$
In the $code build$$ subdirectory of the
$cref/distribution directory/download/Distribution Directory/$$
execute the command
$codep
    make check
$$
This will build and run all of the tests that are support
by your system and the $cref cmake$$ command options.

$head Subsets of make check$$
In unix, you can determine which subsets of $code make check$$ are available
by putting the output of the $cref/cmake command/cmake/CMake Command/$$
in a file (called $icode cmake.out$$ below) and executing:
$codei%
    grep 'make check.*available' %cmake.out%
%$$

$head First Level$$
The first level of subsets of $code make check$$ are described below:
$table
Command $cnext
    Description
$rnext
$code make check_introduction$$   $cnext
    the $cref Introduction$$ functions
$rnext
$code make check_example$$   $cnext
    the normal $cref/example/listallexamples/$$ functions plus some deprecated
    examples.
$rnext
$code make check_test_more$$ $cnext
    correctness tests that are not examples
$rnext
$code make check_speed$$ $cnext
    correctness for single thread $cref speed$$ tests
$rnext
$code make check_cppad_ipopt$$ $cnext
    the deprecated $cref cppad_ipopt_nlp$$ speed and correctness tests
$rnext
$tend
Note that $code make check_example_multi_thread$$ is used for the
$cref/multi-threading/multi_thread/$$ speed tests.
