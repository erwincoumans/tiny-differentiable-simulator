$section Including Sacado Speed Tests$$

$head Sacado Home Page$$
$href%https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/tree/master/packages/sacado%$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD includes speed comparisons for the Sacado AD package;
see $cref speed_sacado$$.

$head sacado_prefix$$
If Sacado is installed on your system, you can
specify a value for its install $icode sacado_prefix$$ on the
$cref cmake$$ command line.
The value of $icode sacado_prefix$$ must be such that,
for one of the directories $icode dir$$ in
$cref/cmake_install_includedirs/cmake/cmake_install_includedirs/$$,
$codei%
    %sacado_prefix%/%dir%/Sacado.hpp
%$$
is a valid way to reference to the include file $code Sacado.hpp$$;

$head Speed Tests$$
If you include $icode sacado_prefix$$ on the $cref cmake$$ command line,
you will be able to run the Sacado speed correctness tests
by executing the following commands starting in the
$cref/distribution directory/download/Distribution Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd build/speed/sacado
    make check_speed_sacado
%$$
After executing $code make check_speed_sacado$$,
you can run a specific Sacado speed test
by executing the command $code ./speed_sacado$$;
see $cref speed_main$$ for the meaning of the command line
options to this program.

$head get_sacado$$
If you are using Unix, you can download and install
a copy of Sacado using $cref get_sacado.sh$$.
The corresponding $icode sacado_prefix$$ would be
$code build/prefix$$.
