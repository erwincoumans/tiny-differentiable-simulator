$section Including Fadbad Speed Tests$$

$head Fadbad Home Page$$
$href%http://www.fadbad.com%$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD includes speed comparisons for the Fadbad AD package; see
$cref speed_fadbad$$.

$head fadbad_prefix$$
If Fadbad is installed on your system, you can
specify a value for its install $icode fadbad_prefix$$ on the
$cref cmake$$ command line.
The value of $icode fadbad_prefix$$ must be such that,
for one of the directories $icode dir$$ in
$cref/cmake_install_includedirs/cmake/cmake_install_includedirs/$$,
$codei%
    %fadbad_prefix%/%dir%/FADBAD++/badiff.h
%$$
is a valid way to reference to the include file $code badiff.h$$;

$head Speed Tests$$
If you include $icode fadbad_prefix$$ on the $cref cmake$$ command line,
you will be able to run the Fadbad speed correctness tests
by executing the following commands starting in the
$cref/distribution directory/download/Distribution Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd build/speed/fadbad
    make check_speed_fadbad
%$$
After executing $code make check_speed_fadbad$$,
you can run a specific Fadbad speed test
by executing the command $code ./speed_fadbad$$;
see $cref speed_main$$ for the meaning of the command line
options to this program.

$head get_fadbad$$
If you are using Unix, you can download and install
a copy of Fadbad using $cref get_fadbad.sh$$.
The corresponding $icode fadbad_prefix$$ would be
$code build/prefix$$.
