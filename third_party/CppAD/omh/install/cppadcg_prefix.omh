$section Including Cppadcg Speed Tests$$

$head Cppadcg Home Page$$
$href%https://github.com/joaoleal/CppADCodeGen.git%$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD includes speed comparisons for the Cppadcg AD package; see
$cref speed_cppadcg$$.

$head cppadcg_prefix$$
If Cppadcg is installed on your system, you can
specify a value for its install $icode cppadcg_prefix$$ on the
$cref cmake$$ command line.
The value of $icode cppadcg_prefix$$ must be such that,
for one of the directories $icode dir$$ in
$cref/cmake_install_includedirs/cmake/cmake_install_includedirs/$$,
$codei%
    %cppadcg_prefix%/%dir%/cppad/cg/cg.hpp
%$$
is a valid way to reference to the include file $code cg.hpp$$;

$head Speed Tests$$
If you include $icode cppadcg_prefix$$ on the $cref cmake$$ command line,
you will be able to run the Cppadcg speed correctness tests
by executing the following commands starting in the
$cref/distribution directory/download/Distribution Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd build/speed/cppadcg
    make check_speed_cppadcg
%$$
After executing $code make check_speed_cppadcg$$,
you can run a specific Cppadcg speed test
by executing the command $code ./speed_cppadcg$$;
see $cref speed_main$$ for the meaning of the command line
options to this program.

$head get_cppadcg$$
If you are using Unix, you can download and install
a copy of Cppadcg using $cref get_cppadcg.sh$$.
The corresponding $icode cppadcg_prefix$$ would be
$code build/prefix$$.
