$section Download The CppAD Source Code$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD is an include file library and you therefore need the source
code to use it.
This section discusses how to download the different versions of CppAD.

$head Distribution Directory$$
We refer to the CppAD source directory created by the download instructions
below as the distribution directory.
As a check, the distribution directory contains the file
$code include/cppad/cppad.hpp$$.

$head Version$$
A CppAD $icode version$$ number has the following fields:
$icode yyyy$$ is four decimal digits denoting a year,
$icode mm$$ is two decimal digits denoting a month,
and $icode dd$$ is two decimal digits denoting a day.
For example $icode%version% = 20160101%$$ corresponds to January 1, 2016.

$head Release$$
Special versions corresponding to the beginning of each year
have $icode dd$$ equal to zero.
These version numbers are combined with release numbers denoted by
$icode rel$$.
Higher release numbers correspond to more bug fixes.
For example
$icode%version%.%rel% = 20160000.0%$$ corresponds to the first release
of the version for 2016,
$code 20160000.1$$ corresponds to the first bug fix for 2016.
The compressed archive names on the github
$href%https://github.com/coin-or/CppAD/releases%releases%$$ page
are named $icode%version%.%rel%.tar.gz%$$.
Before 2019,
these archives correspond to the Eclipse Public License Version 1
license and do not include the documentation.
Starting in 2019,
these archives correspond to the EPL 2.0 or (GPL 2.0 or later) license and
a separate compressed archive is available
on the releases page with name $icode%version%.doc.tar.gz%$$.


$head Git$$
CppAD source code development is current done using $code git$$
You can a git clone of the current version using the command
$codei%
    git clone https://github.com/coin-or/CppAD.git cppad.git
%$$
This procedure requires that
the $href|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29|git|$$
is installed on your system.

$subhead Version$$
After downloading the source code,
and changing into the distribution directory,
use the following command to determine the corresponding
$cref/version/download/Version/$$:
$codep
    grep '^SET(cppad_version' CMakeLists.txt
$$
Use the following command to determine the git $icode hash$$ code
corresponding to this version:
$codep
    git show-ref | grep 'refs/heads/master'
$$
You can get an old version using the command
$codei%
    git checkout -q %hash%
%$$
You can check the corresponding version number using the command
$codep
    grep '^SET(cppad_version' CMakeLists.txt
$$

$subhead Compressed Archives$$
You can build a compressed archive, from a clone of the git repository,
using the script $code bin/package.sh$$.
These archives have the documentation in the $code doc$$ directory
and do not have the $code git$$ information.
They are intended for re-distribution.

$subhead Documentation$$
The documentation at the web address
$href%https://coin-or.github.io/CppAD%$$ is for the
most recent version of CppAD.
You can get the documentation
for an other versions of CppAD.
To do so, in the distribution directory execute the following commands:
$codep
    git checkout gh-pages
    git log > junk.log
$$
The file $code junk.log$$ will contain the git $icode hash$$ codes
for different version of the documentation along with the date.
Select the $icode hash$$ for the version you are using, execute the command
$codei%
    git checkout %hash%
%$$
You can then view documentation for version you are using by opening the file
$code doc/index.html$$ in a web browser.

$subhead Building Documentation$$
The documentation for CppAD can be built, from a clone of the git repository,
using $href%http://www.seanet.com/~bradbell/omhelp/%OMhelp%$$.
You will need to install the $code omhelp$$ command so that
$codep
    which omhelp
$$
shows it is in your path.
Once you have done this,
in the distribution directory execute the following command:
$codei%
    bin/run_omhelp.sh htm
%$$
You can then view documentation for version you are using by opening the file
$code doc/index.html$$ in a web browser.
