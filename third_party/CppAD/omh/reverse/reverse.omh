$head Multiple Directions$$
Reverse mode after $cref/Forward(q, r, xq)/forward_dir/$$
with number of directions $icode%r% != 1%$$ is not yet supported.
There is one exception, $cref reverse_one$$ is allowed
because there is only one zero order forward direction.
After such an operation, only the zero order forward
results are retained (the higher order forward results are lost).
