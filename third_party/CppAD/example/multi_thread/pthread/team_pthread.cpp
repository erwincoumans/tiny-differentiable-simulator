$head Bug in Cygwin$$

There is a bug in $code pthread_exit$$,
using cygwin 5.1 and g++ version 4.3.4,
whereby calling $code pthread_exit$$ is not the same as returning from
the corresponding routine.
To be specific, destructors for the vectors are not called
and a memory leaks result.
Set the following preprocessor symbol to 1 to demonstrate this bug:

# define DEMONSTRATE_BUG_IN_CYGWIN 0
