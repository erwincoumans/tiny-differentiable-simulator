$section Speed Test of Functions in Double$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD has a set of speed tests for just calculating functions
(in double precision instead of an AD type).
This section links to the source code the function value speed tests.

$head Running Tests$$
To build these speed tests, and run their correctness tests,
execute the following commands starting in the
$cref/build directory/cmake/Build Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd speed/double
    make check_speed_double VERBOSE=1
%$$
You can then run the corresponding speed tests
with the following command
$codei%
    ./speed_double speed %seed%
%$$
where $icode seed$$ is a positive integer.
See $cref speed_main$$ for more options.
