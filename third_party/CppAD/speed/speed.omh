$section Speed Test an Operator Overloading AD Package$$

$head Purpose$$
Cppad has a set of speed tests that are used to determine if
changes improve its execution speed.
These tests can also be used to compare the AD packages
$cref/Adolc/adolc_prefix/Adolc Home Page/$$,
Cppad,
$cref/Fadbad/fadbad_prefix/Fadbad Home Page/$$,
$cref/Cppadcg/cppadcg_prefix/Cppadcg Home Page/$$,
$cref/Sacado/sacado_prefix/Sacado Home Page/$$.

$head debug_which$$
Usually, one wants to compile the speed tests in release mode.
This can be done by setting
$cref/cppad_debug_which/cmake/cppad_debug_which/$$ to $code debug_none$$
in the cmake command.
Correctness tests are included for all the speed tests,
so it is possible you will want to compile these tests for debugging; i.e.,
set $icode cppad_debug_which$$ to $code debug_all$$.

The sections below explain how you can run these tests on your computer.
