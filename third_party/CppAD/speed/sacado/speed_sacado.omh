$section Speed Test Derivatives Using Sacado$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to compare
Sacado with other AD packages.
This section links to the source code the Sacado speed tests
(any suggestions to make the Sacado results faster are welcome).

$head sacado_prefix$$
To run these tests,
you must include the $cref sacado_prefix$$
in you $cref/cmake command/cmake/CMake Command/$$.


$head Running Tests$$
To build these speed tests, and run their correctness tests,
execute the following commands starting in the
$cref/build directory/cmake/Build Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd speed/sacado
    make check_speed_sacado VERBOSE=1
%$$
You can then run the corresponding speed tests
with the following command
$codei%
    ./speed_sacado speed %seed%
%$$
where $icode seed$$ is a positive integer.
See $cref speed_main$$ for more options.
