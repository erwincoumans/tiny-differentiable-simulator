$section Speed Test of Derivatives Using Adolc$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to compare
Adolc with other AD packages.
This section links to the source code the Adolc speed tests
(any suggestions to make the Adolc results faster are welcome).

$head adolc_prefix$$
To run these tests,
you must include the $cref adolc_prefix$$
in you $cref/cmake command/cmake/CMake Command/$$.


$head Running Tests$$
To build these speed tests, and run their correctness tests,
execute the following commands starting in the
$cref/build directory/cmake/Build Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd speed/adolc
    make check_speed_adolc VERBOSE=1
%$$
You can then run the corresponding speed tests
with the following command
$codei%
    ./speed_adolc speed %seed%
%$$
where $icode seed$$ is a positive integer.
See $cref speed_main$$ for more options.
