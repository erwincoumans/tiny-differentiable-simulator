$section Speed Test Derivatives Using CppAD$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to determine if
certain changes improve its execution speed
(and to compare CppAD with other AD packages).
This section links to the source code the CppAD speed tests
(any suggestions to make the CppAD results faster are welcome).


$head Running Tests$$
To build these speed tests, and run their correctness tests,
execute the following commands starting in the
$cref/build directory/cmake/Build Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd speed/cppad
    make check_speed_cppad VERBOSE=1
%$$
You can then run the corresponding speed tests
with the following command
$codei%
    ./speed_cppad speed %seed%
%$$
where $icode seed$$ is a positive integer.
See $cref speed_main$$ for more options.
