$section Speed Test Derivatives Using Fadbad$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to compare
Fadbad with other AD packages.
This section links to the source code the Fadbad speed tests
(any suggestions to make the Fadbad results faster are welcome).

$head fadbad_prefix$$
To run these tests,
you must include the $cref fadbad_prefix$$
in you $cref/cmake command/cmake/CMake Command/$$.


$head Running Tests$$
To build these speed tests, and run their correctness tests,
execute the following commands starting in the
$cref/build directory/cmake/Build Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd speed/fadbad
    make check_speed_fadbad VERBOSE=1
%$$
You can then run the corresponding speed tests
with the following command
$codei%
    ./speed_fadbad speed %seed%
%$$
where $icode seed$$ is a positive integer.
See $cref speed_main$$ for more options.
