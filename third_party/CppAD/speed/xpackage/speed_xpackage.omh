$section Speed Test Example and Template for a New Package$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to compare
AD packages.
This section can be used as a starting point for linking a new package
to he CppAD speed tests.

$head Files$$
Use the following command, in the
$cref/distribution directory/download/Distribution Directory/$$,
to see which files link the example package $code xpackage$$
to the speed tests:
$codei%
    git grep -l xpackage
%$$

$head Template$$
Suppose $icode your_package$$ is the name of a package you
want to add to the speed tests.
If you are using a Unix system,
executing the following commands in the distribution directory
will use $code xpackage$$ as a template for your package:
$codei%
    cp -r speed/xpackage speed/%your_package%
    for file in `ls speed/%your_package%`
    do
        sed -i speed/%your_package%/@file -e 's|xpackage|%your_package%|'
    done
%$$
where $icode your_package$$ has been replaced by the name of the new package.


$head Running Tests$$
To build the xpackage version of the tests,
execute the following commands starting in the
$cref/build directory/cmake/Build Directory/$$:
$codei%
    cd speed/xpackage
    make check_speed_xpackage VERBOSE=1
%$$
You can then run the corresponding speed tests
with the following command
$codei%
    ./speed_xpackage speed %seed%
%$$
where $icode seed$$ is a positive integer.
See $cref speed_main$$ for more options.
