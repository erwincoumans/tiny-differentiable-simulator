$section Speed Test Derivatives Using Cppadcg$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to compare
Cppadcg with other AD packages.
This section links to the source code the Cppadcg speed tests
(any suggestions to make the Cppadcg results faster are welcome).

$head Building Tests$$
Starting in the
$cref/build directory/cmake/Build Directory/$$,
execute the following commands
$codei%
    cd build/speed/cppadcg
    ./speed_cppadcg %test% %seed% %option_list%
%$$
A message saying that the sizes are incorrect will be printed.
In addition, it will say that source code with the correct sizes
has been created.
If you then execute
$codei%
    make check_speed_cppadcg VERBOSE=1
%%$$
It will build $code speed_cppadcg$$ with the proper sizes and
run its correctness tests.


$head Running Tests$$
You can then run the corresponding speed tests
with the either of the following commands:
$codei%
    ./speed_cppadcg speed %seed% onetape
    ./speed_cppadcg speed %seed% onetape optimize
%$$
where $icode seed$$ is a positive integer.
See $cref speed_main$$ for more options.
